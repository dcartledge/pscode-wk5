// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

console.log ("Enter five separate numbers:")

store console.log in array [a]

function avg of [a] = b
function min of [a] = c
function max of [a] = d

println ("The average is:") b
println ("The smallest number is:) c
println ("The largest number is:) d
